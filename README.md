# now playing©️

## Description

now playing©️ is the ultimate app for finding out what movies are playing right now, and that's about it. You likely already know what's in the theaters, but when you need a quick app to show your squad before you make plans for the evening, this is it. Movie data is populated via [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Account handling is done via a local backend built in Express.

This project was done as a part of Turing School of Software and Design's curriculum. You can find out more here(https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker).

one of the biggest challanges that I approached with this project was learning SASS and SmaCSS. The architecture was a great departure from what I was used to, and the required strict adherence to indentations and layout of the css caused quite a bit more challenges than I was originally hoping. I ended up modeling the app, in it's most simplest form, after the American Apparel (rip) app, with their bold fonts and plain backgrounds. It's unlikely I'd use SmaCSS again, as it went against the component based architecture I became used to.
