## Project Expectations

To have a low-stress project that also challenges me in new ways and forces me to make components smaller and more modular than before and nail redux.

## Goals and expectations:

Nick: To get a good enough handle on Redux that I can use it on personal projects, and to master passing props and state throughout my apps.

Cierra: Get comfortable with Redux, use SASS

Ahmad: Understand redux, learn CSS

## Team strengths

Nick: moderately good at design / everything CSS. Good grasp on react router. Could use more work on APIs and passing props/state. What is redux?

Cierra: Researching and very resourceful

Ahmad: Javascript OOP

## How to overcome obstacles

Nick: Communicate communicate communicate. This will not be successful without everyone being all in and communicating regularly.

Cierra: Slack

Ahmad: Slack

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Nick: Free schedule, but there are three of us, so paired programming doesn't make a ton of sense. Pick roles / duties, communicate the entire time

Ahmad: depending on difficulty, have login done by friday, sunday main functionality, sun-wed styles and cleanup

Cierra: Slack, communicate often

All: work separately when able to, communicate as often as possible, seek help when you need it

## Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?)

All: as often as possible. slack me all hours of the day

## Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Nick: Redux, Passing state/props, would like to learn at least one new magical thing this project.

Cierra: All around improvement, React, Redux

Ahmad: Styling / CSS / Redux

## Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

everyone: testing

Nick: Everyone says I should take over the design aspect, so I guess that's a start. Ping movie api properly and then focus on the layout 

Ahmad: login from the start ( today )

Cierra:

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests)

Nick: Work on a branch - > write a function -> commit -> get FN to work -> write test -> commit -> get test to pass -> make sure nothing breaks -> commit / push / merge. Utilize PR template and explain what you wrote

## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback

Nick: I am very open and will tell you when you're doing really well / could use improvement. I hope for the same.
